  Why this is a UX mess:

  You're right - separating Triggers from Steps makes no
  sense. Here's what they built:

  Workflow Blueprint
  ├── Steps (sequential tasks)
  │   ├── Step 1: Application Review
  │   ├── Step 2: Background Check
  │   └── Step 3: Interview
  │
  └── Triggers (separate list, not tied to steps)
      ├── "Send email when task completes" (which task?
  unclear)
      ├── "Notify HR on status change"
      └── "Reminder after 3 days"

  What it SHOULD be:

  Workflow Blueprint
  ├── Step 1: Application Review
  │   ├── Assignment: HR Manager
  │   ├── On Complete: Send email to applicant
  │   └── If overdue: Notify supervisor
  │
  ├── Step 2: Background Check
  │   ├── Assignment: Investigator
  │   ├── On Complete: Auto-advance if passed
  │   └── On Complete: Reject if failed
  │
  └── Step 3: Interview
      └── ...

  The current design problems:
  1. Triggers are workflow-level, not step-level (so you
  can't say "when THIS step completes, do X")
  2. There's a workflow_step_id field (line 31) but it's
  nullable and clearly an afterthought
  3. You have to mentally map triggers to steps yourself
  4. The "visual builder" was probably built to solve
  this... but doesn't actually work

  TL;DR: Triggers should be configured ON each step, not as
   a separate list. The current UX forces you to think
  about two disconnected things that should be one.
